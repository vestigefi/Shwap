A box where you put in money, you wait and then you get money out. The box manager gets a 1BP fee.


Based on the conversation I heard from sbf, w/r to crypto. Apparently just 
doing something like this is somehow creating value, so I wanted to put that
to the test. Maybe I'm wrong though, idk. Might launch it, might not, still 
uncertain.
